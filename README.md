# RDFData

The RDFData collected within the Open Discovery Project.

## Naming Conventions

* The Turtle file xxx.ttl contains data of the
  <http://opendiscovery.org/Data/xxx/> RDF graph. Usually xxx is in plural
  form.

* The instances within such an RDF graph are named by naming conventions that
  are specified elsewhere (to be added). All instances of a certain type have
  a namespace prefix <http://opendiscovery.org/Data/xxx/> in common where xxx
  is usually in singular form.
